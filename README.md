# Build a Fullstack Chat app to learn Socket.io

## About Socket.io

We'll build a fullstack chat app using [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) a library for managing realtime, bi-directional, event based communication between a client (frontend) and server.

## Starter code

I created a starter frontend for you so you can focus on the socket server and client implementation rather than the form/ui creation. In this tutorial we will create a socket chat server. Then we will install [socket.io-client](https://socket.io/docs/v4/client-installation/) and rewire the frontend to connect to the server for bi-directional chat driven communication.
